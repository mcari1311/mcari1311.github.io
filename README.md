Future Plans 

While completing this project there were features or additions I thought would be great to work on in the future.

Adding more levels, with unique obstacles in addition to the computer car (like traffic cones, puddles, etc.). This would add a cool, new layer of depth to the game. 

I also think adding a powerups feature would be a great addition. Maybe allowing the player to slow the cars down or withstand 1 collison. 

With the basics and a few extras already down, I'm confident that the ceiling for this game is high.
