Race Car Game 

Description 

This project allows users to play a car game against the computer. Using the left and right arrow keys, the user will try to doge oncoming computer cars. There are 3 levels, made to get progressively more difficult. Throughout each level users can see their score on the lower left corner and choose their prefered car. 

Brief Example

Here are screenshots from the Race Car Game:

Future Plans 

While completing this project there were features or additions I thought would be great to work on in the future.

Adding more levels, with unique obstacles in addition to the computer car (like traffic cones, puddles, etc.). This would add a cool, new layer of depth to the game. 

I also think adding a powerups feature would be a great addition. Maybe allowing the player to slow the cars down or withstand 1 collison. 

With the basics and a few extras already down, I'm confident that the ceiling for this game is high.
